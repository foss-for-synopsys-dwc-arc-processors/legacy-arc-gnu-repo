	* README: Fix a typo.

2008-03-07  Keith Seitz  <kseitz@sourceware.org>

	* generic/gdbtk-register.c (map_arg): New data type
	for passing arguments to mapping functions.
	(map_func): New definition of mapping function.
	Changed all callers to use these new types.
	* generic/gdbtk-stack.c (gdb_get_vars_command): Change
	cast to int to dereference of int *.
	* generic/gdbtk-wrapper.c: Change all casts to char * for
	results and args to use pointer or integer flavor of
	gdb_wrapper_args.results and .args.
	* generic/gdbtk-wrapper.h: struct gdb_wrapper_arguments
	members result and args now return a union of void * and int.
